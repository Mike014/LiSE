<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Life sims all seem to have two problems in common:</p>
<section id="too-much-world-state">
<h2>Too much world state<a class="headerlink" href="#too-much-world-state" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The number of variables the game is tracking – just for game logic,
not graphics or physics or anything – is very large. Like how The
Sims tracks sims’ opinions of one another, their likes and dislikes
and so forth, even for the ones you never talk to and have shown no
interest in. If you streamline a life sim to where it doesn’t have
extraneous detail complexity you lose a huge part of what makes it
lifelike. This causes trouble for developers when even <em>they</em> don’t
understand why sims hate each other</p>
<p>To address all those problems, LiSE provides a state container.
Everything that ever happens in a game gets recorded, so that you can
pick through the whole history and find out exactly when the butterfly
flapped its wings to cause the cyclone. All of that history gets saved
in a database, which is used in place of traditional save files.
This means that if your testers discover something strange and want
you to know about it, they can send you their database, and you’ll
know everything they did and everything that happened in their game.</p>
</section>
<section id="too-many-rules">
<h2>Too many rules<a class="headerlink" href="#too-many-rules" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Fans of life sims tend to appreciate complexity. Developers are best
served by reducing complexity as much as possible. So LiSE makes it
easy to compartmentalize complexity and choose what of it you want to
deal with and when.</p>
<p>It is a rules engine, an old concept from business software that lets
you determine what conditions cause what effects. Here, conditions are
Triggers and effects are Actions, and they’re both lists of Python
functions. Actions make some change to the state of the world, while
Triggers look at the world once-per-turn and return a Boolean to show
whether their Actions should happen.</p>
<p>The connection between Trigger and Action is arbitrary; you can mix
and match when you want. If you’re doing it in the graphical
interface, they look sort of like trading cards, so constructing a
rule is like deckbuilding.  Triggers and Actions exist independent of
the game world, and can therefore be moved from one game to another
without much fuss. I intend to include a fair number of them with the
release version of LiSE, so that you can throw together a toy sim
without really writing any code.</p>
</section>
<section id="architecture">
<h2>Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#architecture" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>LiSE is a tool for constructing turn-based simulations following rules
in a directed graph-based world model. It has special affordances for
the kinds of things you might need to simulate in the life simulation
genre.</p>
<p>Rules are things the game should do in certain conditions. In LiSE,
the “things to do” are called Actions, and are functions that can run
arbitrary Python code. The conditions are divided into Triggers and
Prereqs, of which only Triggers are truly necessary: they are also
functions, but one of a rule’s Triggers must return True for the
Action to proceed.</p>
<p>A directed graph is made of nodes and edges. The nodes are points
without fixed locations–when drawing a graph, you may arrange the
nodes however you like, as long as the edges connect them the same
way. Edges in a directed graph connect one node to another node, but
not vice-versa, so you can have nodes A and B where A is connected to
B, but B is not connected to A. But you can have edges going in both
directions between A and B. They’re usually drawn as arrows.</p>
<p>In LiSE, edges are called Portals, and nodes may be Places or
Things. You can use these to represent whatever you want, but they
have special properties to make it easier to model physical space: in
particular, each Thing is located in exactly one node at a time
(usually a Place), and may be travelling through one of the Portals
leading out from there. Regardless, you can keep any data you like in
a Thing, Place, or Portal by treating it like a dictionary.</p>
<p>LiSE’s directed graphs are called Characters. Every time something
about a Character changes, LiSE remembers when it happened – that is,
which turn of the simulation. This allows the developer to look up the
state of the world at some point in the past.</p>
<p>When time moves forward in LiSE, it checks all its rules and allows
them to change the state of the world. Then, LiSE sets its clock to
the next turn, and is ready for time to move forward another
turn. LiSE remembers the entire history of the game, so that you can
travel back to previous turns and try things a different way.  This is
also convenient for debugging simulation rules.</p>
<p>LiSE can keep track of multiple timelines, called “branches,” which
can split off from one another. Branches normally don’t affect one
another, though it’s possible to write rules that change one branch
when they are run in another.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="lise">
<h1>LiSE<a class="headerlink" href="#lise" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The only LiSE class that you should ever instantiate yourself is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Engine</span></code>. All the other simulation objects should be
created and accessed through it. By default, it keeps the simulation
code and world state in the working directory, but you can pass in another
directory if you prefer. Either use it with a context manager
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">Engine()</span> <span class="pre">as</span> <span class="pre">eng:</span></code>) or call its <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.close()</span></code> method when you’re done
changing things.</p>
<p>The top-level data structure within LiSE is the character. Most
data within the world model is kept in some character or other;
these will quite frequently represent people, but can be readily
adapted to represent any kind of data that can be comfortably
described as a graph. Every change to a character
will be written to the database.</p>
<p>LiSE tracks history as a series of turns. In each turn, each
simulation rule is evaluated once for each of the simulated
entities it’s been applied to. World changes are
recorded such that the whole world state can be
rewound: simply set the properties <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">branch</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turn</span></code> back to
what they were just before the change you want to undo.</p>
<section id="world-modelling">
<h2>World Modelling<a class="headerlink" href="#world-modelling" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Start by calling the engine’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">new_character</span></code> method with a string
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">name</span></code>.  This will return a character object with the name you
provided. Now draw a map by calling the method <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">new_place</span></code> with many
different <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">name</span></code> s, then linking them together with the
method <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">new_portal(origin,</span> <span class="pre">destination)</span></code>.</p>
<p>To store data pertaining
to some particular place, retrieve the place from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">place</span></code>
mapping of the character: if the character is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">world</span></code> and the place
name is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'home'</span></code>, you might do it like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">home</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">world.place['home']</span></code>. Portals are retrieved from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">portal</span></code>
mapping, where you’ll need the origin and the destination: if there’s
a portal from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'home'</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'narnia'</span></code>, you can get it like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wardrobe</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">world.portal['home']['narnia']</span></code>, but if you haven’t also
made another portal going the other way,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">world.portal['narnia']['home']</span></code> will raise <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">KeyError</span></code>.</p>
<p>Things, usually being located in places (but possibly in other things),
are most conveniently created by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">new_thing</span></code> method of Place objects:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alice</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">home.new_thing('alice')</span></code> gets you a new Thing object
located in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">home</span></code>. Things can be retrieved like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alice</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">world.thing['alice']</span></code>.
Ultimately, things and places are both just nodes, and both can be
retrieved in a character’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">node</span></code> mapping, but only things have
methods like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">travel_to</span></code>, which finds a path to a destination
and schedules movement along it.</p>
<p>You can store data in things, places, and portals by treating them
like dictionaries.  If you want to store data in a character, use its
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stat</span></code> property as a dictionary instead. Data stored in these
objects, and in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">universal</span></code> property of the engine, can vary
over time, and be rewound by setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turn</span></code> to some time before.
The engine’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eternal</span></code> property is not time-sensitive,
and is mainly for storing settings, not simulation data.</p>
</section>
<section id="rule-creation">
<h2>Rule Creation<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-creation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>To create a rule, first decide what objects the rule should apply
to. You can put a rule on a character, thing, place, or portal; and
you can put a rule on a character’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thing</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">place</span></code>, and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">portal</span></code> mappings, meaning the rule will be applied to <em>every</em> such
entity within the character, even if it didn’t exist when the rule was
declared.</p>
<p>All these items have a property <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rule</span></code> that can be used as a
decorator. Use this to decorate a function that performs the rule’s
action by making some change to the world state. The function should take
only one argument, the item itself.</p>
<p>At first, the rule object will not have any triggers, meaning the action
will never happen. If you want it to run on <em>every</em> tick, pass the decorator
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">always=True</span></code> and think no more of it. But if you want to be
more selective, use the rule’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trigger</span></code> decorator on another
function with the same signature, and have it return <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code> if the
world is in such a state that the rule ought to run. Triggers must never
mutate the world or use any randomness.</p>
<p>If you like, you can also add prerequisites. These are like triggers,
but use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prereq</span></code> decorator, and should return <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code> <em>unless</em>
the action should <em>not</em> happen; if a single prerequisite returns
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">False</span></code>, the action is cancelled. Prereqs may involve random elements.
Use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">engine</span></code> property of any LiSE entity to get the engine,
then use methods such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">percent_chance</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dice_check</span></code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="time-control">
<h2>Time Control<a class="headerlink" href="#time-control" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The current time is always accessible from the engine’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">branch</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turn</span></code> properties. In the common case where time is advancing
forward one tick at a time, it should be done with the engine’s
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">next_turn</span></code> method, which polls all the game rules before going to
the next turn; but you can also change the time whenever you want, as
long as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">branch</span></code> is a string and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turn</span></code> is an integer. The rules
will never be followed in response to your changing the time “by
hand”.</p>
<p>It is possible to change the time as part of the
action of a rule. This is how you would make something happen after a
delay. Say you want a rule that puts the character <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alice</span></code> to sleep,
then wakes her up after eight turns (presumably hour-long).:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">alice</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">engine</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">character</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;alice&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At the end of a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plan():</span></code> block, the game-time will be reset to its
position at the start of that block.</p>
</section>
<section id="input-prompts">
<h2>Input Prompts<a class="headerlink" href="#input-prompts" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>LiSE itself doesn’t know what a player is or how to accept input from them,
but does use some conventions for communicating with a user interface
such as ELiDE.</p>
<p>To ask the player to make a decision, first define a method for them to
call, then return a menu description like this one.:</p>
